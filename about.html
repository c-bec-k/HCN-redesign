            Rachel has always been in love with breakfast foods. After being fed
            up with a variety of health problems, she turned to food for the
            solution. She learned what did and didn't work for her. Sugar and
            oil were out, which meant so was granola. Then one day Christopher
            said, "you can probably make it without." Using her food and
            nutrition knowledge she did and it was amazing! They decided they
            couldn't keep it all to themselves and HippieChick Noms was born.
            Now you can enjoy our love for breakfast (or anytime) granola!

              Not only does she make the granola but she gives the company its

              Christopher is the nerd of the company who likes his spreadsheets
              and numbers. Using his head for figures, he is the business
              manager for HippieChick Noms and manages the back-end of things.
              When possible he does like to attend markets and events to meet
              people.
